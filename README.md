DOCKER ARCHITECTURE:
===================

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68a06664-9b86-45b8-a381-4d126d26b1a7)




Docker architecture is designed to be lightweight and efficient, enabling developers to build, ship, and run applications in containers. Here are the key components:

1. **Docker Engine**: The core part of Docker, which follows a client-server architecture. It includes:
   - **Server (dockerd)**: The Docker daemon that creates and manages Docker images, containers, networks, and volumes.
   - **REST API**: Interfaces with the Docker daemon to execute commands.
   - **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Allows users to interact with Docker using commands.

2. **Docker Client**: The interface through which users interact with Docker. It sends commands to the Docker daemon via the Docker API.

3. **Docker Registries**: Repositories where Docker images are stored. Docker Hub is the default public registry, but private registries can also be used.

4. **Docker Objects**: These include images, containers, networks, and volumes:
   - **Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers. They can be pulled from registries or built from Dockerfiles.
   - **Containers**: Executable instances of Docker images that run applications.
   - **Networks**: Allow containers to communicate with each other.
   - **Volumes**: Persist data generated by and used by Docker containers
Docker compose:
==============

Docker compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
it allows you to define the services, networks, and volumes that make up your application in a declarative YAML file, which can then be used to spin up manage the containers that make up your application.
Using Docker Compose , you can define a group of related services that can be run together in a single environment, making it easier to manage comple applications with multiple components. For example, your can define a web application with a webserver, a database, and  a caching layer as separate services, each running in its own container.
Docker Compose Commands:
