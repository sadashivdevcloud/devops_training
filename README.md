LINUX BASICS
Linux commands are used to interact with the system's shell (typically Bash). Below is a categorized list of commonly used Linux commands:

🔧 File and Directory Management
ls – List directory contents
cd – Change directory
pwd – Print working directory
mkdir – Create a new directory
rm – Remove files or directories
cp – Copy files or directories
mv – Move or rename files or directories
touch – Create an empty file
📄 File Viewing and Editing
cat – View file contents
less – View file contents one page at a time
nano – Command-line text editor
vim – Advanced command-line text editor
head – View the first lines of a file
tail – View the last lines of a file
🔍 Searching and Finding
find – Search for files in a directory hierarchy
grep – Search inside files for matching text
locate – Quickly find files by name
🖥️ System Monitoring
top – View running processes
htop – Interactive process viewer (enhanced top)
df – Report disk space usage
du – Estimate file or directory size
free – Show memory usage
📦 Package Management (Ubuntu/Debian)
apt update – Update package lists
apt upgrade – Upgrade installed packages
apt install <package> – Install a new package
apt remove <package> – Remove a package
👤 User Management
whoami – Show current user
id – Show user ID and group ID
adduser <username> – Add a new user
passwd <username> – Change user password
su – Switch user
sudo – Run a command with superuser privileges
🔒 Permissions
chmod – Change file permissions
chown – Change file ownership
umask – Set default file permissions
🔗 Networking
ping <host> – Test network connectivity
ifconfig / ip a – View network interfaces
netstat – Show network connections
ssh <user>@host – Connect to another system via SSH
scp – Securely copy files between systems
DOCKER ARCHITECTURE
Docker Architecture

Docker's architecture is designed to be lightweight and efficient, enabling developers to build, ship, and run applications in containers. Below are the key components:

1. Docker Engine
The core part of Docker, following a client-server architecture:

Server (dockerd) – The Docker daemon that creates and manages Docker images, containers, networks, and volumes.
REST API – Interfaces with the Docker daemon to execute commands.
Command-Line Interface (CLI) – Allows users to interact with Docker using commands.
2. Docker Client
The interface through which users interact with Docker. It sends commands to the Docker daemon via the Docker API.

3. Docker Registries
Repositories where Docker images are stored. Examples include:

Docker Hub – The default public registry.
Private Registries – For custom use cases.
4. Docker Objects
Images – Read-only templates used to create containers.
Containers – Executable instances of Docker images that run applications.
Networks – Allow containers to communicate with each other.
Volumes – Persist data generated by and used by containers.
DOCKER COMPOSE
Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It simplifies managing complex applications with multiple components.

Key Features:
Define services, networks, and volumes in a declarative YAML file.
Manage related services in a single environment.
Common Docker Compose Commands
Category	Command	Description
Setup	docker-compose up	Build, start, and attach to containers
docker-compose up -d	Start containers in detached mode
docker-compose build	Build or rebuild services
docker-compose build --no-cache	Build without cache
docker-compose pull	Pull service images
Teardown	docker-compose down	Stop and remove containers, networks, volumes, and images
docker-compose down --volumes	Also remove named volumes
docker-compose stop	Stop services
docker-compose rm	Remove stopped containers
Management	docker-compose start	Start existing services
docker-compose restart	Restart services
docker-compose logs	Show service logs
docker-compose logs -f	Follow logs output
docker-compose exec <service> <command>	Run command in a running container
docker-compose run <service> <command>	Run one-off command in a new container
docker-compose ps	List running containers
Debugging	docker-compose config	Validate and show config
docker-compose top	Display container processes
Scaling	docker-compose scale <svc>=<count>	Scale a service (deprecated in Compose v3 and later)
